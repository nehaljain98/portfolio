      <div class="storyline-title">The Story</div>
      <div class="storyline-description">
        The UC Davis CStem website is one of the most visited university websites. The site has a lot of different users, but is especially relevant to the 30,000+ K-12 student population that use the site at some point in their robotic and coding career as it contains all the information about the program requirements. Unfortunately, as you will see in the "Personas" section of this case study, users find the site unappealing and are often unable to find the information that they need. As a result, both students and faculty are frustrated with the poor web experience.
        <br><br>
        <b>The objective:</b> <br><br> My student team was tasked with gathering data about the site‚Äôs users, and came up with mockups to explore what a redesigned site might look like. Our objective was to redesign a multi-purpose website that would achieve the center's goal and serve user efficiently.
        <br><br>
        <b>My Role:</b> <br><br> I designed and prototyped the branding and layout of the website.
        Valeria and I contributed to user research, interviews and surveys. We worked frequently and closely with the project manager who was supervising our work.

          <div class="step-description">
            The old site‚Äôs bad user experience has been a source of frustration for UC Davis students and faculty, so university administrators asked us to explore solutions to the site's problems. We conducted user research and used UC Davis style guides to inform our redesign, and validated our work using a final prototype, which we would present to a group of university stakeholders..

      The current website deisgn lacks a good information architecture and overwhelms users with loads of information. In this quick demo, we can see that finding information is difficult because the navigation bar has no clear value path. Moreover, due to consistent updates, there are duplicate pages which would confuse users even more.

      There is only one person who works on the website in the CSTEM department, and unfortunately, he has been unable to redesign it so far. University administrators, who manage department operation, still want to explore improving the user experience:

				<div class="storyline-title">The Solution</div>
				<div class="storyline-description">
				We designed a set of new features within the JAPA app that supports a much wider range of needs. The new design takes new and returning users on a more controlled,
				personalized journey and uses unique features such as the map quick look to list view, filtering, and garage level card swipe to guide drivers smoothly to their destination.
				By integrating these features and mimicking the in-app journey to the external parking experience, JAPA creates a more full, guided experience for users and builds a more
				lasting relationship with them.

          <div class="break-down-description">
              We chose to use a survey to discover what the different user segments are. We deliberated on whether an online or an in-person survey was more appropriate. We picked the most effecient user reseach method given our limited resources and decided on online survey.
              <br>We posted the survey on various faculty and student groups on Facebook. We also emailed school administrators with the survey. In total, we got 56 responses from students and 26 from administrators. Through the survey we gained an understanding of who was using the site, and what they were using it for.

            To get more understand what these users‚Äô goals and pain points on the site were, we conducted more in-depth interviews where we would walk through the website with 5 people from each user group.
            The during the interviews we performed a contextual inquity (or walkthrough) of the website with our interviewees to observe how they used the site and what information they wanted to access. We also asked them both preestablished and followup questions about their goals and habits as users.
            Based off of those interviews, we were able to create personas (who are fictional people with motivations and oppinions that average those of the people interviewed).

        <br>We wanted to make sure that all of our personas, especially the parents, could access their information quickly without having to read a lot of text. So we restructured the site to facilitate the access of information from the use cases, (the information that they desired most).
        <br>Since students are the majority of the user population, we made sure that all of the information that they need is within the ‚ÄúCurriculum‚Äù section because that‚Äôs where they tend to look first (based off of our interview observations). To do this, we regrouped and added some relevant pages to the section. Previously, the modules required another click but we have made all the information available in two clicks.
        <br>Moreover, we created a different navigation tab for partners that contains all the information that they would want to access, 
        <br>Downloads are also available in the first tab which was a special request from the center's stakeholders. 
        <br>The news and events were also cleanly categorized under one nav tab which allows for a smoother user experience.

					<div class="break-down-description">
            Overall, the information architecture created a cleaner path than the previous website design. This allowed us to move on to wireframing.
            We created layouts based on user goals and UCD web patterns. After inserting and removing pages, and rearranging pages on the sitemap we were able to start sketching new website layouts. As we sketched and wireframed, we explored layouts that followed existing UC Davis website patterns, but also entertained new ideas that could help the CSTEM website establish its own unique character.
            During the wireframing process, we decided that using more modern UC Davis website‚Äôs design patterns would be the best layout choice for several reasons
            <br><br>The website would be consistent with modern UC Davis branding and style guides.
            The website experience would be consistent with other UC Davis sites; this would reduce users' effort to understand the redesigned site and would reduce their cognitive load.
            <br>Abiding by stylistic standards is important as the school continues to scale the number of websites that it has.
            Examples of websites with modern UC Davis patterns would be the UC Davis home page and the UC Davis SISS website.

                After the usability tests, Valeria and I used a Powerpoint and Functional Specification Report to present our process and results to key stakeholders in the CSTEM department. They liked our ideas, however, they also explained to us that the department was facing internal debate. Since, the department was facing some budget issues, they could not spare funds for the development of the websites. The intent was to use our research and redesigns to keep for future purposes when they will be able to allocate capital for the online experience. 
                
                <br><br>We understood why there would be hesitation in regards to spending financial capital as well as time on this endeavour: 
                
                <br><br>1. Changing the site is a lot of work and will require a team of developers
                <br>2. Changing the site will force people who are used to using the site to relearn the new site

                <br><br>Regardless, it‚Äôs a little bit disappointing to see progress hindered by matters that had not been considered. Nevertheless, I am grateful for this complication, because there are lessons here that a lot of students don‚Äôt get to learn about in more ordinary projects.

                    In an effort to understand why nthe website was so costly and time-consuming, I sat down with the Education Service Manager, Daniel Ryan. He helped me understand that the university uses a tool called Sitefarm to build it's websites, which houses templates and assets for creating sites, so a redesign that follows existing UC Davis patterns would be made easier through that resource.

                    Nevertheless, he estimates that with all of the information that would need to be migrated from the old website, the effort could easily take between 1 and 2 months and required good amount of capital.
