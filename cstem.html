      <div class="storyline-title">The Story</div>
      <div class="storyline-description">
        The UC Davis CStem website is one of the most visited university websites. The site has a lot of different users, but is especially relevant to the 30,000+ K-12 student population that use the site at some point in their robotic and coding career as it contains all the information about the program requirements. Unfortunately, as you will see in the "Personas" section of this case study, users find the site unappealing and are often unable to find the information that they need. As a result, both students and faculty are frustrated with the poor web experience.
        <br><br>
        <b>The objective:</b> <br><br> My student team was tasked with gathering data about the site‚Äôs users, and came up with mockups to explore what a redesigned site might look like. Our objective was to redesign a multi-purpose website that would achieve the center's goal and serve user efficiently.
        <br><br>
        <b>My Role:</b> <br><br> I designed and prototyped the branding and layout of the website.
        Valeria and I contributed to user research, interviews and surveys. We worked frequently and closely with the project manager who was supervising our work.

      <div class="main-step-title">Why is the current website design not working?</div>
          <div class="step-description">
            The old site‚Äôs bad user experience has been a source of frustration for UC Davis students and faculty, so university administrators asked us to explore solutions to the site's problems. We conducted user research and used UC Davis style guides to inform our redesign, and validated our work using a final prototype, which we would present to a group of university stakeholders..

      The current website deisgn lacks a good information architecture and overwhelms users with loads of information. In this quick demo, we can see that finding information is difficult because the navigation bar has no clear value path. Moreover, due to consistent updates, there are duplicate pages which would confuse users even more.

      There is only one person who works on the website in the CSTEM department, and unfortunately, he has been unable to redesign it so far. University administrators, who manage department operation, still want to explore improving the user experience:

				<div class="storyline-title">The Solution</div>
				<div class="storyline-description">
				We designed a set of new features within the JAPA app that supports a much wider range of needs. The new design takes new and returning users on a more controlled,
				personalized journey and uses unique features such as the map quick look to list view, filtering, and garage level card swipe to guide drivers smoothly to their destination.
				By integrating these features and mimicking the in-app journey to the external parking experience, JAPA creates a more full, guided experience for users and builds a more
				lasting relationship with them.

              We chose to use a survey to discover what the different user segments are. We deliberated on whether an online or an in-person survey was more appropriate. We picked the most effecient user reseach method given our limited resources and decided on online survey.
              <br>We posted the survey on various faculty and student groups on Facebook. We also emailed school administrators with the survey. In total, we got 56 responses from students and 26 from administrators. Through the survey we gained an understanding of who was using the site, and what they were using it for.

          Search and getting to information are a priority. The majority of users enjoy looking for specifics instead of browsing through all the information. We also wanted to take inspiration from the Davis Housing magazine and use methods from editorial design so that the listings base is a delight to read.

                  I'll be focusing on what I did in this section.
                  I built off the original app's bare bones structure and designed an interactive parking facility layout. After I went through several iterations of wireframes and mid-fidelity prototypes and
                  incorporated feedback from the team, I prepared some high-fidelity prototypes for A/B and usability testing.
