      <div class="storyline-description">
        Unfortunately, the work I did at Davis Housing must remain confidential at this time. What I can say is that I helped lay the foundation for the digital experience of a new infromation-search engine. I collaborated with a team to build the pilot version of the website that was built and launched for testing: presenting designs, and research to the stakeholders weekly. Additionally, collaborated with the engineering team to ensure my designs were built to spec. The launch date currently remains TBD. But If you would like to check out Davis Housing's previous website, then click <a target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù  href = "https://davishousing.com/">here</a>.

      <div class="storyline-description">
        My team and I were challenged to build off of the current website and redesign the user experience. For the purpose of this Knowledge Base redesign, we planned and executed market research, user research, user testing, prototypes, visual design, and collaborated directly with the product manager and other stakeholders.
        <br><br>
        <b>The main objectives:</b> <br><br> 1) Redesign the entire website to provide users with a smooth and pleasant experience 
        <br> 2) Apply a unique feature to stand-out from the competition
        <br> 3) Design for scalability and future feature integrations
        <br><br>
        <b>My Role:</b> <br><br> I designed and prototyped the searchbar, listings and advertising layout of the website.
        My team and I all contributed to research, idea generation, and the final presentation. We all worked frequently and closely with Davis Housing's CTO to get feedback and build our solutions.

      <div class="small-process-title">Problem Space</div>
      <div class="main-step-title">What is the current housing situation and why is it a problem?</div>
          <div class="step-description">
            With Davis being a university town, the space is flooded with students looking for housing. The apartments are rented out in a cycle of succession of four years and there is a constant need for apartments.   
            Moreover, the locals in Davis want to find houses to rent or buy based on their personal parameters. Looking for housing is a tedious process. 
            People need to take out valuable time to look at multitudes of factors affecting their decision. Usually, this is a joint decision which makes it harder to communicate and come to a conclusion.

          <div class="current-experience-title">Why aren't users engaging with the online presence of this service?</div>
          This is what the current website experience looks like. In this quick demo, we can see that the davis housing website is in desperate need of a redesign. It is wasting important space and not giving any real information but lists of the apartments. Moreover, the current color scheme and logo is off-brand.

    <div class="small-text-title">Space for opportunity</div>
    <div class="problem-title">What if we focused on allowing customers to have an online walk-through experience especially given COVID?</div>
    Most housing-listing websites focus on listing housing with amenities and location. Since we wanted to do things a little different, we realized that we can utilize a social feature that allows users to communicate with each other. Moreover, we wanted to expand on this feature by incorporating an online walk-in view of the apartment listings. We encouraged apartments to add 360 photos that would allow users to have a real experience virtually.

<div class="solution-container">

				<div class="storyline-title">The Solution</div>
				<div class="storyline-description">
          We designed a set of new features within the website that supports a much wider range of needs. The new design takes new and returning users on a more controlled,
          personalized journey and uses unique features such as the map quick look to list view, filtering, and social features that allows users to share their likes, dislikes and even find potential roommates.
          By integrating these features and re-designing the branding, Davis Housing creates a smooth and guided experience that improves the user's house-searching experience.
          <br>I'm proud to say that, even after completing my job, the design vision and insights that I helped develop are still being used by Davis Housing teams today.
