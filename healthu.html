      <div class="storyline-title">The Story</div>
      <div class="storyline-description">
        Is it a cold? Is it a flu? Is it COVID? 
        <br>Due to the rise of COVID, this year's annual flu season will start up while we‚Äôre still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The only way to truly diagnose whether you have the flu or COVID-19 is through testing. However, a lot of doctors encourage people to self-diagnose through symptoms. After my personal experience of trying to figure out if it is COVID or the common flu, I decided to create and design an app which will aid people in self-diagnosing so that they are better informed about their own health.
        <br>For the purpose of this Knowledge Based design, I planned and executed market research, user research, prototypes, visual design to create a relaxed user experience.
        <br><br>
        <b>The main objectives:</b> <br><br> 1) Design the app to provide users with a smooth and pleasant experience 
        <br> 2) Apply a unique feature to stand-out from the competition
        <br> 3) Design for scalability and future feature integrations

    <div class="main-step-title">What is the current COVID situation and why do we need this app?</div>
        <div class="step-description">
          Since COVID-19 is a type of viral flu, it shares symptoms with the common cold and flu. During the winter season, it makes health matters worse because all three have overlapping symptoms. There is a need for understanding the differences so that people know when to take action and get medicial care.

          <div class="current-experience-title">Why aren't users able to find this information online?</div>
          People can currently go online and look at symptoms to figure out if they have a flu or COVID. However, based on user research they are still not able to find an answer efficiently. Due to multiple information sources giving users mixed information, users end up feeling confused and even more scared. Moreover, the information overload is daunting and overwhelming for the average user.

    As of September 2020, there were no apps that were aiding users in this mission. Since websites only list out symptoms for these diseases, there is no organized manner of self diagnosis. The ability to be able to select your symptoms and seeing the probability of each viral. With the use of some important differences, people will be able to come to a more conclusive evidence.

        Health U is a Siri app/skill that allows users to explain and check symptoms, providing health assessments, and guiding the user towards care options. This app will help users to check symptoms and discover what might be causing them without an appointment. Using user research and system research, this app uses doctor-based thinking for the purpose of user's health.

          Note: I understand that currently the AI is not present to support the feautre of my skill regarding real-time step-by-step diagnosis at the speed that would be preferred. However, this project is an ideal state inspired by real user need that deserves ideation and implementation in the near future.

              Organizing and grouping user flows for effecient navigation.

                <br>Since the organization of information on the website was an issue brought up in our personas, we wanted to take a look at the persona use cases and see:
                
                <br>Where their final page destinations were on the sitemap
                <br>What user navigation paths looked
                <br> The person icons indicate the ending page for each of the personas' navigation paths.
                We wanted to make sure that all of our personas, especially the international students, could access their information quickly without having to read a lot of text. So we restructured the site to facilitate the access of information from the use cases, (the information that they desired most).

                Since students are the majority of the user population, we made sure that all of the information that they need is within the ‚ÄúAcademics‚Äù section because that‚Äôs where they tend to look first (based off of our interview observations). To do this, we regrouped and added some relevant pages to the section. Previously, academic information was scattered outside of ‚ÄúAcademics‚Äù in sections like ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù and ‚ÄúPrograms & Services‚Äù. Now, more relevant information is in the section, and as seen in the revised sitemap, more students‚Äô use cases fall in ‚ÄúAcademics‚Äù.
                    
                <br>We also wanted to include multiple paths for users to reach their desired page. This way, no matter what the user navigation decisions, users can reach their destinations more quickly.

            We wanted to connect the site's information architecture to its visual design by showing paths between pages. Wireframing aided us in clarifying consistent ways for displaying particular types of information on the user interface. As you can see from the sketches, we explored intended functionality in the interface and worked on different landing pages. Our main focus was on the home page because there isn't a lot of information so we wanted to gain and keep attention for the users to be able to reach the destination they wanted.

          In the end, the succession of leadership is responsible for the continuation of the website. We took on the responsibility of creating the website based on user research. We still feel that the organisation should do a lot more research into design systems because there was an overwhelming number of synonymous design patterns for club organisations. Moreover, we would have preferred to code the website as we had the skills but unfortunately we decided to go with Weebly so that it is easy to edit for the future board members. We think that the website will benefit from being coded and hosted. The interaction and animation will improve the website. It is important to understand the limits and parameters of a project and we respected the criterion.
