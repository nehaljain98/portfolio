        Digital Psychology (also known as web psychology) takes a different approach. It looks at online behaviour through the lens of psychology and behavioral economics ‚Äì and through this lens, explains why customers are acting the way they are. Better still, by applying the lessons learned from social science theory, we‚Äôre able to remove barriers to online conversion, and increase customer spend and retention.
        <br><br>
        <b>The main objectives:</b> <br><br> 1) Research digital psychology principles and its applicabilty in designs
        <br> 2) Create UI animations based on digital psychology principles

          <div class="step-description">
            A lot of digital psychology theory is counter intuitive ‚Äì people often do the opposite of what we instinctively expect, and brands need to understand that simply following the HiPPO (Highest Paid Person‚Äôs Opinion) is a recipe for disaster. During a psychological backfiring study, they concluded that social psychology was the most dangerous form of misapplied psychology because it was the most common source of backfires tied to the worst outcomes. It is extremely important for designers to use digital psychology correctly.

          <div class="current-experience-title">Is digital psychology unethical?</div>
            Cyberpsychologists often deal with moral issues and dilemmas. These range from the daily awareness of distributive justice, as they consider the imbalanced allocation of technologies in society, to discussing and balancing the complex issues involved in research. These situations are often challenging and some quite perplexing. Some of these situations can be seen in popular social media sites and apps. For example, facebook‚Äôs principal approach to revenue generation violates the ethical principle of privacy. Our technologies are progressively developing into algorithmic devices that seamlessly interface with digital personhood. If people are intimately linked to their technologies, then removing or damaging the technology could be tantamount to a personal attack. On the other hand, algorithmic devices may threaten autonomy and privacy.

    Upon my research, I realized that there is a lot of research still being done in this field and there is no clear result yet. However, I chose to focus on persuasive methods that have more to do with the UI design features and less based on personal data since that will decrease the ethical issues.

          <div class="break-down-description">
            If you‚Äôve ever subscribed to a company e-mail newsletter, you‚Äôve likely seen an advertisement promoting a ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù or ‚Äúcollectable‚Äù item. Using the theory of loss aversion, people feel a heavier impact when they lose an opportunity than they‚Äôd feel if they gained that same opportunity. This tactic can be used one of two ways: convince customers to purchase an item sooner than later or convince customers to buy a novel or premium model with the stipulation that the deal will not return. Brands don‚Äôt necessarily focus on what you will get. They focus on what you‚Äôll lose if you don‚Äôt take actions.
            <br> In this project, I have focused on flash sale items that are showcasing the decrease in price. When you see a flash sale on an e-commerce site ‚Äòyour sense of urgency and excitement arousal clouds thinking, and it takes 20 minutes to regain full mental control once your brain has gone into excitement mode‚Äô (Kit Yarrow). Making the customer feel like they might be losing out on a great opportunity can be very effective tactic for sites that want to clear their inventory.

          <div class="break-down-description">
            The digital age has given people the ability to share their opinion on products and services. Thanks to sites like Yelp, people explore new cities with the help of reviews online. Social proof is a psychological and social phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in an attempt to undertake behavior in a given situation. This principle online allows customers to assume that the actions of others represent the correct course of action.

      <div class="break-down-title">Perceived Value</div>
      <div class="break-down-description">
        A common digital psychology principle is to combine products to save on the total cost. We‚Äôve all seen promotions like this: a new shirt costs $40, a new tie costs $20, but the shirt and tie combo is $50 (a $10 savings). This is actually a deal, assuming you want both items, and sets the framework for the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of items.
        People want to get a deal, so retailers will take advantage of this. They will group items together and list them for one price. That singular price is not a bargain at all, it‚Äôs the regular cost of all items. However, listing multiple items at one cost will increase the perceived value of the package as a whole. Amazon does this all the time with their ‚Äúfrequently bought together.‚Äù

      <div class="break-down-description">
        It can be hard to choose between two options, but the decision might not be as hard when there are three options. The idea of introducing a third, dominating option is called the Decoy Effect. When there are only two options, consumers will tend to make decisions according to their personal preferences. But when consumers are offered another strategical decoy option, they will be more likely to choose the more expensive of the two original options. 
        <br>If consumers were only given the started and professional option, then the consumers would have chosen the starter pack. However, compared to the enterprise, they presume savings on professional pack.

<div class="break-down-text">
  <div class="break-down-title">Scarcity</div>
  <div class="break-down-description">
    This tactic relies on the concept of scarcity and the idea that people want to obtain the unobtainable. Marketers using this concept will advertise the limited quantities of an item or a high volume of people trying to obtain the item.
    Similar to loss aversion, scarcity demonstrates the realities of not obtaining a product before supplies run out.

                Humans interact with the digital world more than ever before, so digital psychology is a natural extension of our existing body of knowledge. Web designers and marketers are always trying to increase impressions and earn higher profits. Digital psychology isn‚Äôt studied to enable devious behaviors, it is studied to understand why certain behaviors are so common in digital environments. Digital psychology is centered around heuristic behaviors, responses that come naturally without considering consequences. Often time people will apply logic to their decision making and avoid making an irrational choice. Digital psychology identifies logic in design choices and how humars are expected to respond. I expect the importance of digital psychology to emerge over the next few years as user experience and ecommerce continue to rise in popularity. The field has applications in other areas of human computer interaction as well.
                Personally, I learned a lot from undertaking this project and research. It also helped me explore new forms of UI interactions and animations for the purpose of these principals. I was able to think outside the box since I wanted to come up with original and creative ideas that aren't currently seen in the design of e-commerce websites and apps.
